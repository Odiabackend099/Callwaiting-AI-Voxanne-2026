# Voxanne AI: FAQ Knowledge Base

## Medical Compliance & Security

### Is Call Waiting AI HIPAA compliant?
Yes, Call Waiting AI is built with enterprise-grade security and is fully HIPAA compliant. We sign a BAA (Business Associate Agreement) with every medical practice.

### Does she store patient data?
Call Waiting AI only temporarily processes data needed for booking (name, reason for visit). All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, adhering to strict privacy standards.

### Can she handle medical emergencies?
Call Waiting AI is trained to recognize emergency keywords (e.g., 'bleeding', 'pain', 'breathing'). She immediately routes these calls to your emergency line or instructs the patient to hang up and dial 911/999.

### What about liability if she makes a mistake?
Call Waiting AI operates within your strict guardrails. If she is unsure, she executes a 'Human Escalation Protocol' to transfer the call or take a message. All calls are recorded for your review and liability protection.

## Medical Terminology & Scope

### Does Call Waiting AI understand BBL, Mommy Makeover, etc.?
Yes. Call Waiting AI is pre-trained on 500+ cosmetic and medical procedures, from BBLs and Rhinoplasties to CoolSculpting and Mohs surgery.

### Can she quote pricing?
Only if you want her to. We can configure her to give specific ranges (e.g., '$8k-$12k for BBL') or to defer pricing to the in-person consultation.

### What if a patient asks about recovery time?
Call Waiting AI delivers your approved clinical answers. For example: 'Dr. Chen typically advises 2 weeks off work for a tummy tuck.'

### Can she handle insurance questions?
Call Waiting AI can answer basic network questions ('Do you take Blue Cross?') and route complex billing inquiries directly to your billing coordinator.

## Practice Integration

### What EMRs do you integrate with?
We support direct integrations with major aesthetic EMRs including Mindbody, Nextech, Aesthetics Pro, and DrChrono. We can also connect via custom API.

### How long is setup?
Because Call Waiting AI is pre-trained on medical workflows, we can go live in as little as 48 hours after your 15-minute onboarding call.

### Do I need to train her?
No. Our team configures her voice, knowledge base, and booking rules for you. You just hand us your FAQ doc.

### Can I customize her responses?
Absolutely. In our Growth and Premium tiers, you have full control over her script, tone, and objection handling.

## Business & ROI

### Does she replace my receptionist?
No. Call Waiting AI handles the 'busy work'—overflow calls, after-hours inquiries, and FAQ. This frees your front desk to focus on the high-value patients in front of them.

### What if I want to cancel?
We operate on a month-to-month basis with a simple 30-day notice. We believe you'll stay because of the ROI, not a contract.

### What's the ROI?
Our average plastic surgery client books 3-5 additional consultations per month specifically from after-hours calls. With a $10k avg case value, that's $30k-$50k in retained revenue.
