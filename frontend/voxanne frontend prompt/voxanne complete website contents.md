### **Case Study 1: Radiant Skin Dermatology**

**Hero Image:** Modern dermatology office exterior

**Practice Overview:**  

- **Location:** Miami, FL  
- **Practice Size:** 2 physicians, 8 staff  
- **Specialty:** Medical & cosmetic dermatology  
- **Patient Volume:** 800/month

**The Challenge:**

Dr. Jennifer Martinez's practice was drowning in phone calls. With only 2 front desk staff, they were missing 35-40 calls per week during peak hours (Monday mornings and lunch breaks).

"We'd come in Tuesday morning to 15 voicemails. I knew each one was potential revenue walking out the door to our competitors."

**The Numbers Before Voxanne:**  

- 35 missed calls per week  
- 12% no-show rate  
- Front desk staff overwhelmed  
- $40K estimated monthly revenue loss

**The Solution:**

Implemented Voxanne in July 2025 with the Professional plan. Connected to their Google Calendar and Athenahealth EMR.

**Results After 3 Months:**  

- ✅ 0 missed calls (100% answer rate)  
- ✅ $47,000 additional revenue first month  
- ✅ No-show rate dropped to 7%  
- ✅ Front desk stress reduced by 60% (staff survey)  
- ✅ After-hours bookings: 23% of total appointments

**Quote:**  
*"Voxanne paid for itself in the first week. The ROI is insane. Our staff is happier, patients love it, and we're booking procedures we would have missed entirely."*  
— Dr. Jennifer Martinez, Owner

**Key Features Used:**  

- 24/7 call answering  
- Real-time calendar booking  
- SMS appointment reminders  
- EMR integration

### **Case Study 2: Elite Med Spa**

**Hero Image:** Luxury med spa interior

**Practice Overview:**  

- **Location:** Los Angeles, CA  
- **Practice Size:** Solo esthetician + 3 technicians  
- **Specialty:** Laser treatments, facials, body contouring  
- **Patient Volume:** 300/month

**The Challenge:**

Marcus Thompson's med spa was growing fast, but he couldn't afford another full-time receptionist. Calls during treatment sessions went to voicemail, and weekend inquiries waited until Monday.

"Saturday mornings were our busiest booking time, but we were closed. I knew I was leaving money on the table."

**The Numbers Before Voxanne:**  

- 20 missed weekend calls per week  
- Manually sending appointment reminders (60 min/day)  
- No data on common patient questions  
- Part-time receptionist cost: $2,200/month

**The Solution:**

Started with Voxanne Starter plan in August 2025. Customized voice to match their luxury brand positioning.

**Results After 2 Months:**  

- ✅ Weekend bookings increased 40%  
- ✅ Saved 10 hours/week on phone management  
- ✅ Automated reminders reduced no-shows from 15% to 8%  
- ✅ Cut staffing costs by $1,600/month

**Quote:**  
*"I was skeptical about AI, but clients genuinely can't tell. One client told me 'Your new receptionist is so sweet!' I didn't have the heart to tell her it's AI."*  
— Marcus Thompson, Owner

**Key Features Used:**  

- After-hours coverage  
- Automated SMS reminders  
- Package booking (multi-session treatments)  
- Pricing information sharing

### **Case Study 3: Clarity Aesthetics**

**Hero Image:** Team photo of medical practice

**Practice Overview:**  

- **Location:** Austin, TX  
- **Practice Size:** 3 physicians, 12 staff, 2 locations  
- **Specialty:** Plastic surgery & reconstructive surgery  
- **Patient Volume:** 1,200/month

**The Challenge:**

Dr. Sarah Chen's multi-location practice needed consistent patient experience across both offices. Phone coverage was inconsistent, and routing calls to the right location was a daily challenge.

"Patients would call our downtown office asking for appointments at our north location. Our staff was spending half the day just transferring calls."

**The Numbers Before Voxanne:**  

- 2 receptionists per location ($9,600/month total)  
- 50+ calls per day transferred between locations  
- Inconsistent phone greetings  
- 18% no-show rate

**The Solution:**

Implemented Voxanne Enterprise in September 2025 with custom integration to their Nextech EMR.

**Results After 6 Months:**  

- ✅ Unified patient experience across both locations  
- ✅ Reduced front desk staffing from 4 to 2 (saved $4,800/month)  
- ✅ Zero cross-location transfers  
- ✅ No-show rate dropped to 11%  
- ✅ Consultation bookings up 25%

**Quote:**  
*"Setup was faster than I expected—under 20 minutes. Our patients love the convenience of 24/7 scheduling. This was the easiest efficiency upgrade we've ever made."*  
— Dr. Sarah Chen, Medical Director

**Key Features Used:**  

- Multi-location support  
- EMR integration  
- Department-specific routing  
- Advanced analytics dashboard
