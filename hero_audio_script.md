# Hero Audio Script: Selling "Roxanne" to Clinic Owners

**Objective:** Sell the AI receptionist software to a clinic owner by demonstrating competence, empathy, and business logic.
**Voices:**

* **Clinic Owner (Tom):** Stressed, skeptical, worried about missed revenue (Reptilian).
* **Roxanne (AI):** Calm, ultra-competent, reassuring (Limbic/Cortex).

---

### Phase 1: Reptilian (Survival/Fear)

*Hook the listener by addressing their immediate pain: the chaos of missed calls and revenue loss.*

**Clinic Owner (Tom):** *(Sounding frazzled, background phone ringing)*
"Look, I don't have time for a sales pitch. My front desk is drowning, I'm missing three consults a day, and honestly? I'm watching money walk out the door. Can you actually stop the bleeding, or is this just another 'chatbot'?"

**Roxanne:** *(Warm, confident, zero latency)*
"I hear the stress in your voice, Tom, and you’re right to be protective of your practice. I’m not a chatbot. I’m Roxanne. I answer every single call, 24/7, within one second. No hold times, no busy signals. I stop that bleeding immediately."

### Phase 2: Limbic (Emotion/Trust)

*Shift from fear to relief. Demonstrate empathy and the "luxury" experience for patients.*

**Clinic Owner (Tom):** *(Slightly relieved, but testing)*
"Okay... but my patients expect a high-end experience. They need to feel heard. If you sound like a robot, you'll scare them off."

**Roxanne:**
"I completely agree. Your patients are vulnerable—they’re calling about their bodies, their confidence. I speak with genuine warmth and empathy. I can comfort a nervous BBL patient, explain post-op care gently, or hype up a patient for their transformation. I make them feel safe, Tom. That’s what turns a caller into a patient."

### Phase 3: Cortex (Logic/ROI)

*Close with pure reason. Integration, efficiency, and the undeniable business case.*

**Clinic Owner (Tom):** *(Impressed, thinking logically now)*
"Safe is good... but profitable is better. How do you actually get them into my chair? Do I still need to chase them?"

**Roxanne:**
"Not at all. I integrate directly with your EMR. I qualify the lead, handle the deposit objection, and book the appointment straight into your calendar while you sleep. You wake up to a full schedule, not a to-do list. I cost less than a lunch break, but I earn like a top-tier sales executive. Ready to let me handle the phones?"

### Suggested ElevenLabs Settings

* **Tom:** use a male voice with "Anxious/Urgent" style (e.g., 'Adam' or 'Antoni' with stability lowered).
* **Roxanne:** use **'Sarah'** or **'Deepgram Aura Thalia'** (High stability, warm style).
