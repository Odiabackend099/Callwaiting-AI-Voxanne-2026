# Common Objections & Responses

## "It's too expensive"

**Objection**: "I can't afford £169/month"

**Response**: 
"I understand cost is a concern. Let me put this in perspective:
- One additional consultation per month at £500 covers the entire cost
- Most practices see 3-5 extra bookings per month from better call handling
- That's £1,500-2,500 in additional revenue
- Your ROI is typically 10-20x in the first month

Plus, we offer a 14-day free trial so you can see the results before committing."

## "We already have a receptionist"

**Objection**: "We have staff answering phones"

**Response**:
"That's great! Voxanne actually works alongside your team:
- Handles calls after hours and during busy periods
- Reduces staff workload by 40-60%
- Ensures no calls go unanswered
- Frees your team to focus on patient care
- Many practices use us as backup during holidays or sick leave

Think of it as extending your team's capacity without hiring more staff."

## "Patients won't like talking to AI"

**Objection**: "Our patients prefer talking to humans"

**Response**:
"That's a valid concern. Here's what we've found:
- Patients appreciate instant answers to common questions
- They like being offered appointment slots immediately
- The AI is trained to sound natural and friendly
- For complex questions, it seamlessly transfers to your staff
- 94% of callers don't realize they're speaking to AI initially

You maintain full control - your team handles consultations and procedures. Voxanne just handles the initial greeting and scheduling."

## "We're worried about liability"

**Objection**: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"

**Response**:
"Safety is our top priority:
- The AI is trained on your specific protocols
- It never provides medical advice - only books appointments
- All calls are recorded and monitored
- Your team can review and override any decisions
- We have full liability insurance
- Compliance with GDPR and healthcare regulations

Think of it as a smart voicemail that books appointments."

## "We don't have time to set it up"

**Objection**: "This sounds complicated to implement"

**Response**:
"Setup is actually very simple:
- Takes about 30 minutes total
- Our team handles all the technical work
- You just provide your practice information
- We train your staff in one call
- Full support during the first month

Most practices are live within 24 hours of signing up."

## "We want to try it first"

**Objection**: "Can we test it before committing?"

**Response**:
"Absolutely! We offer:
- 14-day free trial with full features
- No credit card required
- Full access to analytics
- Dedicated onboarding support
- Money-back guarantee if not satisfied

Most practices see results in the first week."
