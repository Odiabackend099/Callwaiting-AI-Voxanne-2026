# 5 CLICKS - That's It

You don't need to understand anything technical. Just do these 5 things.

---

## CLICK 1: Edit One File

Open this file on your computer:
```
backend/.env
```

Find this line:
```
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Delete `http://localhost:3001` and replace with:
```
https://sobriquetical-zofia-abysmally.ngrok-free.dev
```

Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S).

**DONE - Click 1 complete.**

---

## CLICK 2: Go to Vapi Website

Open this in your browser:
```
https://dashboard.vapi.ai
```

Log in if needed.

**DONE - Click 2 complete.**

---

## CLICK 3: Find Sarah

On the left side, click: **Assistants**

Find the one that says something like "CallWaiting AI Inbound" or just look for Sarah.

Click on it.

**DONE - Click 3 complete.**

---

## CLICK 4: Change One URL

You'll see a button that says **Edit** or a pencil icon. Click it.

Then look for a tab that says **Tools**.

You'll see a tool called **bookClinicAppointment**.

Click on it.

You'll see a field that probably says something like:
- "Webhook URL" or
- "Server URL" or
- "URL"

Delete whatever is in that field.

Copy and paste this:
```
https://sobriquetical-zofia-abysmally.ngrok-free.dev/api/vapi/tools/bookClinicAppointment
```

Click **Save**.

Then look for a green button that says **Publish** and click it.

**DONE - Click 4 complete.**

---

## CLICK 5: Restart Your Code

Go to your terminal/command prompt.

You should see something running that says your backend is on.

Press: **Ctrl+C** (this stops it)

Then type:
```
npm run dev
```

Wait for it to say something like "listening on port 3001".

**DONE - Click 5 complete.**

---

## NOW TEST IT

Call your clinic phone number.

When Sarah answers:
- Say: "I want to book an appointment"
- Tell her your name: "Samuel"
- Tell her your email: "samuel@test.com"
- Tell her what service: "Botox"
- Tell her when: "Monday at 6 PM"

Sarah should say: **"Perfect! I've scheduled your appointment"**

If she says that, **you're done**. ✅

---

## IF IT DOESN'T WORK

Don't panic. Text or email me exactly what Sarah said.

I'll fix it remotely or guide you through it.
