## 📋 THE PROMPT (Copy This Exactly)

```
A minimalist, modern logo for "Voxanne AI," a medical AI voice platform for healthcare clinics.

VISUAL CONCEPT:
A central blue geometric node (circle or medical cross variation) with 3-4 concentric sound wave rings emanating smoothly outward. The waves should be elegant, curved lines suggesting voice/audio technology and network connectivity. Think of a pebble dropped in water, but geometric and professional.

STYLE:
Modern geometric, flat design with subtle shadow/depth, tech-forward but deeply professional healthcare aesthetic. Similar style to logos from Slack, Stripe, or Figma—simple shapes with profound meaning. Clean, not cartoony.

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Deep medical blue (#0066CC) for the central node and waves
- Secondary: Pure white for negative space and background
- Accent (optional): Subtle cyan (#00A8E8) for the outermost sound wave ring, suggesting innovation and voice
- Ensure the design works perfectly in monochrome (single blue)

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Must be scalable from 16x16px (favicon) to 512x512px (app icon) without losing detail
- Should work on white backgrounds, dark backgrounds, and as a reversed version
- Clean, professional quality suitable for healthcare credibility
- No gradients or complex textures—solid fills preferred

COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION:
- NOT like ChatGPT's orange spiral (too playful for healthcare)
- NOT like Anthropic's Claude face (too literal, too character-focused)
- NOT like Google's multicolor circles (too generic, no medical focus)
- SHOULD feel: Enterprise healthcare, voice technology, AI trust, medical authority

MUST CONVEY:
✓ Medical professionalism and trustworthiness
✓ Voice/AI technology (sound waves, audio intelligence)
✓ Autonomous intelligence and automation
✓ Secure infrastructure and reliability
✓ Modern, premium positioning

OUTPUT:
High-resolution PNG (3000x3000px minimum), professional quality, production-ready.
