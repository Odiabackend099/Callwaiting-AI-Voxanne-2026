## EMAIL 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

**Subject:** Quick question about {{clinicName}}'s after-hours calls

**Body:**
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{clinicName}} on Google — you've got great reviews.

Quick question: when someone calls at 8pm asking about a BBL consultation, what happens? Voicemail?

I ask because I work with cosmetic clinics to capture those calls 24/7 with an AI patient coordinator that sounds completely human. She answers questions, handles nervous callers with empathy, and books consultations directly into your calendar.

One clinic captured 12 extra consultations in two weeks — calls that would've gone to voicemail.

Want me to have her call your mobile so you can experience it? Takes 60 seconds.

Best,
[Your Name]

## EMAIL 2: Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about {{clinicName}}'s after-hours calls

**Body:**
Hi {{firstName}},

Just floating this back up.

I ran the numbers for a clinic your size — if you're missing even 10 consultation calls a month after hours, and your average procedure is £6,000, that's potentially £720,000 a year in lost revenue (assuming 30% convert).

Ruthie (our AI patient coordinator) costs about 0.1% of that.

Worth a 60-second demo call?

## EMAIL 3: Follow-Up #2 - Value Add (Day 7)

**Subject:** 60-second audio demo (no call needed)

**Body:**
Hi {{firstName}},

I know you're busy, so I recorded a quick demo of Ruthie handling a nervous BBL inquiry:

This is exactly what your patients would hear at 9pm on a Saturday.

If this isn't relevant, no worries — just let me know and I'll stop following up.

## EMAIL 4: Follow-Up #3 - Case Study (Day 10)

**Subject:** How one {{city}} clinic captured £50k in lost consultations

**Body:**
Hi {{firstName}},

Quick case study I thought you'd find interesting:

A cosmetic clinic similar to {{clinicName}} was losing 10-15 consultation calls a month to voicemail. After implementing our AI patient coordinator:

- 12 extra consultations booked in the first 2 weeks
- 90% of after-hours calls now answered
- Zero complaints from patients ("they thought she was human")

At their £7,000 average procedure value, that's potentially £25k+ monthly in revenue they were leaving on the table.

Is this something worth exploring for {{clinicName}}?

## EMAIL 5: Follow-Up #4 - Soft Breakup (Day 14)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

**Body:**
Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times about helping {{clinicName}} capture after-hours consultation calls, but haven't heard back.

Totally understand if the timing isn't right.

If you'd like me to stop reaching out, just reply "not interested" and I'll close your file.

But if you're still curious about how clinics are using AI to book consultations 24/7, I'm happy to chat whenever works for you.

Either way, wishing you continued success with {{clinicName}}.

## EMAIL 6: Final Follow-Up (Day 21)

**Subject:** Last one from me

**Body:**
{{firstName}},

This is my last email — I promise.

Just wanted to leave you with one thought:

Every night and weekend that passes, potential patients are calling cosmetic clinics. The ones who answer are booking consultations. The ones who don't... aren't.

If you ever want to explore how Ruthie can ensure {{clinicName}} never misses another inquiry, my inbox is open.

All the best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — If a colleague might benefit from this, feel free to forward this along.
