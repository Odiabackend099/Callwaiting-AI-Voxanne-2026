Review this function as if you are a senior engineer. Specifically look for the following, and provide a list of potential improvements with reasoning for those improvements:

1. Logical mistakes that could cause errors.
2. Unaccounted for edge cases.
3. Poor or inconsistent naming conventions and styling that would make the code hard to understand.
4. Performance optimizations.
5. Security vulnerabilities or concerns to consider.
6. Ambiguous or hard to understand code that requires documentation.
7. Debugging code that should be removed before pushing to production.
8. Any other ways to improve the code quality, readability, performance, security, scalability, or maintainability.
9. **UI/UX Audit**: For frontend code, does it meet "Premium AI Design" standards? (Inter font, tight tracking, glassmorphism, no jarring reloads, small text). Refer to `.agent/skills/ui-ux-designer/SKILL.md`.
