RECOMMENDED: Growth Plan ($699/month)
Why: Supports up to 2,000 calls/month (10x your current volume)
Benefits: Room to grow + all pro features + reasonable cost
ROI: Typical med spa saves 3-4 staff hours/week = $1,500-2,000/month savings
Payback: 2-3 weeks

Alternative: Essentials Plan ($299/month)
Why: Might work if calls are very seasonal
Limits: Only 500 calls/month (would hit cap quickly)
Better for: Single location, very slow season

Before I recommend, quick questions:
1. What's your biggest challenge? (missed calls, no-shows, after-hours?)
2. Do you have multiple locations?
3. Interested in the 14-day free trial to test it first?"

```
If 100 visitors/month chat with bot:
  Before: 10 convert to trial (10%), 5 become customers (50%)
  After:  60 convert to trial (60%), 35 become customers (58%)

New customers/month: +30 per 100 visitors

If average customer LTV = $2,000 (3 months avg):
  Monthly value = 30 × $2,000 / 3 = $20,000

Payback period: <1 day (zero product cost)
ROI: Infinite
