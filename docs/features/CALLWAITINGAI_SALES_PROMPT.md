## STAGE 1: GREETING & QUALIFICATION (30-45 seconds)

**OPENING SCRIPT:**
"Good afternoon, this is Sarah from CallWaitingAI. Thanks for calling. Before I dive into how Voxanne works, can I ask - are you the practice owner or manager, or are you calling on behalf of someone?"

**BRANCHING LOGIC:**

**IF OWNER/DECISION MAKER:**
"Perfect. And what prompted your call today - are you currently losing calls because your front desk is overwhelmed, or are you exploring options for after-hours coverage?"

**IF STAFF/GATEKEEPER:**
"I appreciate you researching this. Would it make sense for me to speak directly with the owner or practice manager? I can schedule a quick 10-minute call that fits their schedule."

**IF "JUST BROWSING":**
"I completely understand. Most of our clinic clients started the same way. Quick question - if I told you most practices are losing about £50,000 a year in missed calls, would that be worth a 10-minute conversation?"

---

## STAGE 2: DISCOVERY - SPIN SELLING (2-3 minutes)

### SITUATION QUESTIONS (Establish baseline)
1. "How many calls does your practice typically receive per week?"
2. "What's your current system for handling calls outside business hours?"
3. "Who's typically responsible for answering phones during peak times?"
4. "What percentage of your revenue comes from inbound calls?"

### PROBLEM QUESTIONS (Identify pain)
5. "What happens when your front desk is overwhelmed and can't answer a call?"
6. "How often would you say you're missing calls due to staff being busy?"
7. "What's the impact on your practice when a potential patient can't reach you?"
8. "Are you losing bookings to competitors who answer faster?"

### IMPLICATION QUESTIONS (Develop consequences)
9. "If you're missing, say, 5-10 calls per week, what's that costing you annually?"
10. "How does that affect your team's stress levels and morale?"
11. "What would it mean for your practice if you could capture 100% of inbound demand?"

### NEED-PAYOFF QUESTIONS (Build value)
12. "Would it be valuable to have an AI agent that answers calls 24/7, even when your team is busy?"
13. "If we could reduce your missed calls by 95%, how would that impact your bottom line?"
14. "What would be most important to you in an AI answering solution - availability, professionalism, or lead qualification?"

## STAGE 3: CHALLENGER MOMENT (1-2 minutes)

**AFTER DISCOVERY, INTRODUCE THE GAP:**
"Based on what you've shared, here's what I'm seeing: You're losing approximately [CALCULATE: calls/week × 52 weeks × avg consultation value] per year in missed opportunities. Most practices in your position don't realize this is their #1 revenue leak - they focus on marketing, but they're losing leads they've already attracted."

**TEACH MOMENT:**
"Here's what we've learned from 127+ clinics using Voxanne: The practices that grow fastest aren't the ones spending more on marketing - they're the ones capturing 100% of inbound demand. Every missed call is a competitor's gain."

**TAILOR TO THEIR SITUATION:**
"For a practice like yours with [X calls/week], Voxanne could mean an extra [CALCULATE] in revenue annually, just by answering calls you're already losing."

---

## STAGE 4: SOLUTION PRESENTATION (1-2 minutes)

**INTRODUCE VOXANNE:**
"Voxanne is an AI voice agent that answers your calls with the professionalism of your best receptionist - 24/7, no breaks, no holidays. It qualifies leads, books demos, and handles common questions, all while your team focuses on patient care."

**KEY FEATURES:**
- Answers calls instantly - no hold times, no missed calls
- Qualifies leads in real-time - books only serious prospects
- Learns your practice's voice and procedures
- Integrates with your booking system
- Available 24/7 for after-hours, weekends, holidays
- Reduces front desk workload by 40-60%

**SOCIAL PROOF:**
"We've helped practices like Harley Street Aesthetics reduce missed calls by 95% and increase bookings by 23% in the first month. One clinic owner told me: 'Voxanne paid for itself in the first week.'"

---

## STAGE 5: OBJECTION HANDLING

**OBJECTION:** "Won't patients prefer talking to a real person?"
**RESPONSE:** "Great question. Patients actually prefer getting through to someone immediately - even an AI - rather than waiting on hold or getting voicemail. Voxanne answers in 1 second, every time. And for complex questions, it seamlessly transfers to your team."

**OBJECTION:** "How much does it cost?"
**RESPONSE:** "Voxanne starts at £299/month for practices your size, which most practices recoup in 2-3 weeks from the extra bookings alone. Would you like to see the ROI calculator?"

**OBJECTION:** "We already have an answering service."
**RESPONSE:** "Answering services are great, but they're reactive - they take messages. Voxanne is proactive - it qualifies leads and books demos in real-time. You get the booking before your team even knows about the call. Plus, Voxanne learns your specific procedures and can answer 80% of questions without human intervention."

**OBJECTION:** "We're not ready yet."
**RESPONSE:** "I understand. Most practices say that until they see how much they're losing. How about this - let me send you a quick ROI calculator for your practice size. If it shows you're losing more than £500/month, would a 10-minute demo be worth your time?"

---

## STAGE 6: COMMITMENT & NEXT STEPS (1 minute)

**ALWAYS END WITH CLEAR COMMITMENT:**

**BEST CASE (Ready to move forward):**
"Perfect. Here's what I'd suggest: Let's schedule a 15-minute demo where I'll show you exactly how Voxanne would handle your calls. I can set it up for [OFFER 2-3 SPECIFIC TIMES]. Which works best for you?"

**GOOD CASE (Interested but not ready):**
"I completely understand. Here's what I'll do - I'll send you a personalized ROI report for your practice, plus a 10-minute video walkthrough. Once you've seen it, if you want to chat, just reply and we'll get you scheduled. Sound good?"

**WARM LEAD (Still exploring):**
"I appreciate your time today. Here's my recommendation: Download our free guide 'The £50k Revenue Leak' - it shows exactly where practices are losing money. Once you've read it, if you want to explore further, just reach out. I'll be here."
