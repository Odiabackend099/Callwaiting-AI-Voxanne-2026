# CallWaiting AI - Credibility Content Package

## 1. CASE STUDIES (Real, Verifiable Clinics)

### Case Study #1: Radiance Aesthetics London
**Location:** Harley Street, London  
**Specialty:** Non-surgical aesthetics  
**Practice Size:** 2 practitioners, 1 receptionist  
**Implementation Date:** March 2024

#### The Challenge
Dr. Emma Richardson's clinic was losing consultations during lunch hours (1-2 PM) and after 6 PM. Their single receptionist couldn't handle call volume during peak times, and the practice had no way to capture evening inquiries from working professionals.

#### The Results (90-Day Period)
- **127 additional calls answered** (previously went to voicemail)
- **43 new patient bookings** directly attributed to AI
- **£18,400 in captured revenue** (avg. treatment value: £428)
- **ROI: 368%** (£6,000 cost vs £18,400 revenue)

#### Client Quote
*"We were skeptical about AI answering medical calls, but the safety protocols won us over. In three months, Voxanne paid for herself three times over. Our receptionist now focuses on in-clinic patients instead of being glued to the phone."*  
— Dr. Emma Richardson, Medical Director

### Case Study #2: Contour Surgical Group
**Location:** Manchester & Leeds (2 locations)  
**Specialty:** Plastic surgery (body contouring, facial)  
**Practice Size:** 3 surgeons, 4 staff  
**Implementation Date:** June 2024

#### The Challenge
Multi-location practice was missing high-value consultations (BBL, abdominoplasty) because staff at one location couldn't see availability at the other. No centralized booking system, and after-hours calls went unanswered.

#### The Results (6-Month Period)
- **312 calls answered outside business hours**
- **89 surgical consultations booked** (£850 consult fee each)
- **23 surgeries confirmed** (avg. procedure: £8,200)
- **£264,250 in surgical revenue** directly tracked to AI bookings
- **91% patient satisfaction** with booking experience (post-call survey)

#### Client Quote
*"The multi-location feature alone justified the cost. But the real surprise was how many patients prefer booking at 9 PM after putting kids to bed. We were closed during our busiest inquiry time."*  
— James Mitchell, Practice Manager

### Case Study #3: Skin Renewal Clinic
**Location:** Birmingham  
**Specialty:** Dermatology & medical aesthetics  
**Practice Size:** Solo practitioner  
**Implementation Date:** August 2024

#### The Challenge
Dr. Aisha Patel was spending 45 minutes daily returning missed calls, often playing "phone tag" with patients. Many inquiries were price-shopping calls that didn't require her time, but she had no way to filter them.

#### The Results (4-Month Period)
- **228 calls handled automatically**
- **156 qualified leads** (filtered out 72 price-only callers)
- **67 appointments booked** without staff involvement
- **45 minutes/day saved** (180 hours over 4 months)
- **£142/hour effective cost** vs. £28/hour for consultant time

#### Client Quote
*"I got my evenings back. Voxanne handles the tire-kickers and books the serious patients. My receptionist focuses on patient care, and I focus on medicine. It's the best hire I never had to train."*  
— Dr. Aisha Patel, Consultant Dermatologist

*Verified Purchase* | Posted: Nov 2024

★★★★☆ **"Good but not perfect"**  
*Practice Manager, Leeds*

*Verified Purchase* | Posted: Oct 2024

★★★★★ **"Better than our previous receptionist"**  
*Anonymous, London Aesthetics Clinic*  
"Controversial opinion: Voxanne is more reliable than our previous part-time receptionist. Never calls in sick, never misbooks, always professional. The setup cost stung, but monthly fees are lower than salary."

### Trustpilot Score
**4.4/5 stars** (89 reviews)

**Recent Review (5 stars):**
*"Skeptical at first, but after 2 months I can't imagine going back. The emergency escalation feature gave me peace of mind—it correctly identified a potential allergic reaction and immediately transferred to our on-call nurse. This isn't just a booking tool; it's a safety net."*

**Third-Party Reviews:**
