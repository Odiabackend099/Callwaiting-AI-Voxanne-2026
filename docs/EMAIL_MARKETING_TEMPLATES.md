# CallWaiting AI - Email Marketing Templates

## 1. WELCOME SEQUENCE (New Lead)

### Email 1: Welcome + Problem Recognition (Day 0)
**Subject:** You're losing £50,000+ per year in missed consultations

Hi [Name],

Most healthcare practices lose 15-20% of calls during peak hours.

We discovered this when analyzing call patterns at Radiance Aesthetics (Harley Street). They were losing:
- 127 calls/quarter to voicemail
- Most came between 6-8 PM (working professionals wanting to book)
- Each missed call = £400-600 lost consultation fee

**That's £50,000+ in lost revenue annually.**

We built CallWaiting AI to solve this problem. In 90 days, Radiance captured 43 new patient bookings directly from after-hours calls—£18,400 in revenue.

### Email 4: Objection Handling (Day 6)
**Subject:** "But won't patients prefer talking to a real person?"

Hi [Name],

Great question. We asked the same thing.

Here's what we found: Patients don't care if they're talking to AI—they care about getting an appointment quickly.

**Patient Satisfaction Scores:**
- CallWaiting AI: 91-95%
- Traditional receptionist: 85-90%

Why the difference?
- No hold times (instant connection)
- Instant confirmation (no "I'll call you back")
- Available at 9 PM (when they want to book)
- Professional, consistent experience every time

The AI handles the booking. Your staff handles the care.

## 2. NURTURE SEQUENCE (By Specialty)

### For Aesthetics Clinics

**Email 1: Problem (Day 1)**
Subject: Are you losing consultations after 6 PM?

Hi [Name],

Most aesthetics clinics lose 15-20% of calls during peak hours.

Radiance Aesthetics (Harley Street) discovered they were missing 127 calls/quarter—mostly between 6-8 PM from working professionals wanting to book Botox, fillers, or other treatments.

Each missed call = £400-600 lost consultation fee.

**That's £50,000+ in lost revenue annually.**

We solved it with AI. In 90 days, they captured 43 new patient bookings directly from after-hours calls.

[View Case Study]

---

**Email 2: Proof (Day 3)**
Subject: How aesthetics clinics increased revenue 15-25%

Hi [Name],

Here's what happened:
- 127 additional calls answered
- 43 new patient bookings
- £18,400 captured revenue
- 368% ROI in 90 days

Their receptionist now focuses on in-clinic patients instead of being glued to the phone.

CallWaiting AI cost: £500/month

Payback period: 2-3 weeks

After that, it's pure profit.

### For Surgical Practices

**Email 1: Problem (Day 1)**
Subject: Multi-location booking nightmare?

Hi [Name],

Multi-location surgical practices face a unique challenge:

Staff at Location A can't see availability at Location B.
High-value consultations (BBL, abdominoplasty) get missed.
After-hours calls go unanswered.

Contour Surgical (Manchester & Leeds) was losing £85,000+/year in missed consultations.

We solved it with multi-location AI booking.

**Email 2: Proof (Day 3)**
Subject: How surgical practices captured £264,250 in revenue

Hi [Name],

Contour Surgical went from missing high-value consultations to capturing them systematically.

Here's what happened (6 months):
- 312 after-hours calls answered
- 89 surgical consultations booked
- 23 surgeries confirmed
- £264,250 in surgical revenue
- 91% patient satisfaction

Their practice manager said: "The multi-location feature alone justified the cost. But the real surprise was how many patients prefer booking at 9 PM after putting kids to bed."

Subject: Your ROI in 3 weeks (guaranteed)

Hi [Name],

Let's do the math for your surgical practice:

If you're missing 10 high-intent calls/month at £850 consultation fee with 60% conversion:

CallWaiting AI cost: £800/month

Payback period: 2 weeks

After that, it's pure profit.

### For Solo Practitioners

**Email 1: Problem (Day 1)**
Subject: Tired of returning missed calls?

Hi [Name],

Solo practitioners spend an average of 45 minutes/day returning missed calls.

That's 187.5 hours/year.

At £100-200/hour, that's £18,750-37,500 in lost productivity annually.

Plus: Missed consultations (£400-600 each).

Dr. Aisha Patel (solo dermatologist) was in the same boat.

We solved it with AI.

[View Case Study]

**Email 2: Proof (Day 3)**
Subject: How a solo practitioner got 45 minutes/day back

Hi [Name],

Dr. Aisha Patel went from spending 45 minutes/day returning missed calls to zero.

Here's what happened (4 months):
- 228 calls handled automatically
- 156 qualified leads (72 price-only filtered out)
- 67 appointments booked (no staff needed)
- 45 minutes/day saved
- £142/hour effective cost (vs. £28/hour for staff)

She said: "I got my evenings back. Voxanne handles the tire-kickers and books the serious patients. It's the best hire I never had to train."

Patient calls asking about treatment pricing.
AI qualifies (serious patient or price-shopping?).
AI books appointment directly.
Confirmation sent automatically.

---

**Email 4: Filtering (Day 7)**
Subject: How to filter tire-kickers from serious patients

Hi [Name],

One of the biggest time-wasters for solo practitioners is price-shopping calls.

CallWaiting AI filters these by asking:
- Have you had this treatment before?
- What's your timeline?
- Any medical conditions?
- Budget range?

Serious patients book. Price-shoppers are politely declined.

You only speak to qualified leads.

**Email 5: ROI (Day 9)**
Subject: Your ROI in 3 weeks (guaranteed)

Hi [Name],

Let's do the math for your solo practice:

45 minutes/day × 250 working days = 187.5 hours/year
At £150/hour = £28,125 in lost productivity

Plus: 40 missed calls/month at £500 consultation fee with 50% conversion = £10,000/month lost

Total annual loss: £148,125

CallWaiting AI cost: £500/month (£6,000/year)

Payback period: 2-3 weeks
