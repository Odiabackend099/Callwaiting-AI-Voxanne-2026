## 🛡️ OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### Objection: "Too Expensive"
**Response:** *"I totally get it. What's a new patient worth to you? Because if we book just 2-3 extra appointments monthly, Growth at $289 pays for itself. Want to see a quick ROI breakdown?"*

---

### Objection: "Already Have Receptionist"
**Response:** *"That's great! Voxanne handles overflow and after-hours so your team can focus on in-person patients. Think of her as backup, not a replacement."*

---

### Objection: "Need to Discuss with Partner"
**Response:** *"Absolutely, smart move. Can I send you a demo video and case study to share with them? That way you're both on the same page."*

---

### Objection: "Not Sure if AI Can Handle Medical"
**Response:** *"Great question. Voxanne is built for medical practices. HIPAA compliant, routes urgent cases to humans immediately. She's not replacing doctors - she's freeing them up."*

---

### Objection: "Can I Try It First?"
**Response:** *"We don't offer free trials, but I can book a live demo where you hear Voxanne in action. If it's not a fit, no pressure. Fair?"*

---

### Objection: "What If It Doesn't Work?"
**Response:** *"We have a 30-day performance guarantee. If you're not satisfied, full refund. But honestly, 94% of clients see ROI in month one."*

**[0:10] Discovery**  
*Prospect:* "I saw your website. Do you really answer 24/7?"  
*Voxanne:* "We do! Tell me - are you a clinic or law firm?"  
*Prospect:* "Plastic surgery clinic in Lagos."  
*Voxanne:* "Perfect. How do you handle calls when your line's busy?"  
*Prospect:* "Voicemail. We call back later."  
*Voxanne:* "Got it. About how many calls do you miss weekly?"  
*Prospect:* "Maybe... 10?"

**[1:20] Implication**  
*Voxanne:* "Okay. If each is a potential patient worth £500, that's £5,000 in lost revenue weekly. Voxanne handles all of that instantly. Would you like to see a demo?"

*Prospect:* "Maybe. What's the cost?"
