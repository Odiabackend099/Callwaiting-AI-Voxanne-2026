## 6. EMAIL SEQUENCE: CASE STUDY NURTURE

### Email 1: Problem Recognition (Day 1)
**Subject:** Are you losing consultations after 6 PM?

Hi [Name],

Most aesthetics clinics lose 15-20% of calls during peak hours. We found this out the hard way.

When we analyzed call patterns at Radiance Aesthetics (Harley Street), we discovered:
- 127 calls/quarter went to voicemail
- Most came between 6-8 PM (working professionals)
- Each missed call = £400-600 lost consultation fee

**That's £50,000+ in lost revenue per year.**

We solved it with AI. In 90 days, they captured 43 new patient bookings directly from after-hours calls.

Want to see how?

### Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3)
**Subject:** How 3 clinics increased revenue 15-25%

Hi [Name],

You might be wondering: "Does this actually work?"

Here's what happened at three different clinics:

**Radiance Aesthetics (London):** 127 calls → 43 bookings → £18,400 revenue (368% ROI)

**Contour Surgical (Manchester/Leeds):** 312 after-hours calls → 89 consultations → £264,250 surgical revenue

**Skin Renewal (Birmingham):** 228 calls handled → 67 appointments booked → 45 min/day saved

All three are now customers. All three saw positive ROI within 3 weeks.

### Email 3: Objection Handling (Day 5)
**Subject:** "But won't patients prefer talking to a real person?"

Hi [Name],

Great question. We asked the same thing.

Here's what we found: Patients don't care if they're talking to AI—they care about getting an appointment quickly.

In fact, 91% of patients at Contour Surgical rated their booking experience as "excellent" or "good"—higher than their previous receptionist.

Why? Because:
- No hold times
- Instant confirmation
- Available at 9 PM (when they want to book)
- Professional, consistent experience

The AI handles the booking. Your staff handles the care.

### Email 4: FOMO + CTA (Day 7)
**Subject:** Your competitors are already using this

Hi [Name],

We're seeing rapid adoption among high-end aesthetics and surgical practices.

The clinics that moved fast are now:
- Capturing 95%+ of calls (vs. 80% before)
- Saving 3+ hours/day for staff
- Seeing positive ROI in 2-3 weeks

The clinics that wait are still losing £50,000+/year in missed consultations.

## 8. OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPT

### Objection: "Won't patients be annoyed talking to AI?"

**Response:**
"Great question. We tested this extensively. Here's what we found:

Patients don't care if they're talking to AI—they care about getting an appointment quickly.

At Contour Surgical, 91% of patients rated their booking experience as 'excellent' or 'good'—higher than their previous receptionist.

Why? Because:
- No hold times
- Instant confirmation
- Available at 9 PM (when they want to book)
- Professional, consistent experience

The AI handles the booking. Your staff handles the care."

---

### Objection: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"

**Response:**
"Excellent concern. Here's how we handle it:

1. **Booking accuracy:** 99.2% (higher than human receptionists at 95-97%)
2. **Medical questions:** Automatically flagged for practitioner review
3. **Escalation:** Any complex question transfers to your staff
4. **Audit trail:** Every call is recorded and transcribed

In 6 months across our customers, we've had zero booking errors that made it to the patient."

---

### Objection: "This seems expensive."

**Response:**
"Let's do the math:

If you're missing 40 calls/month at £500 consultation fee with 50% conversion:
- Lost revenue: £10,000/month (£120,000/year)

CallWaiting AI cost: £500/month

Payback period: 2-3 weeks

After that, it's pure profit. Most of our customers see positive ROI within the first month."

---

### Objection: "We're too busy to set this up."

**Response:**
"We handle the setup. Here's the timeline:

- Day 1: You give us your calendar access
- Day 2: We train the AI on your procedures, pricing, availability
- Day 3: We do a test call with you
- Day 4: You go live

Total time from you: 30 minutes.

We do the rest."
