---

## PROMPT 1: The Voice Node (RECOMMENDED FIRST CHOICE)

### Primary Prompt (Midjourney/DALL-E 3 Format)

```
A minimalist, modern logo for "Voxanne AI," a medical AI voice platform for healthcare clinics.

VISUAL CONCEPT:
A central blue geometric node (circle or medical cross variation) with 3-4 concentric sound wave rings emanating smoothly outward. The waves should be elegant, curved lines suggesting voice/audio technology and network connectivity. Think of a pebble dropped in water, but geometric and professional.

STYLE:
Modern geometric, flat design with subtle shadow/depth, tech-forward but deeply professional healthcare aesthetic. Similar style to logos from Slack, Stripe, or Figma—simple shapes with profound meaning. Clean, not cartoony.

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Deep medical blue (#0066CC) for the central node and waves
- Secondary: Pure white for negative space and background
- Accent (optional): Subtle cyan (#00A8E8) for the outermost sound wave ring, suggesting innovation and voice
- Ensure the design works perfectly in monochrome (single blue)

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Must be scalable from 16x16px (favicon) to 512x512px (app icon) without losing detail
- Should work on white backgrounds, dark backgrounds, and as a reversed version
- Clean, professional quality suitable for healthcare credibility
- No gradients or complex textures—solid fills preferred

COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION:
- NOT like ChatGPT's orange spiral (too playful for healthcare)
- NOT like Anthropic's Claude face (too literal, too character-focused)
- NOT like Google's multicolor circles (too generic, no medical focus)
- SHOULD feel: Enterprise healthcare, voice technology, AI trust, medical authority

MUST CONVEY:
✓ Medical professionalism and trustworthiness
✓ Voice/AI technology (sound waves, audio intelligence)
✓ Autonomous intelligence and automation
✓ Secure infrastructure and reliability
✓ Modern, premium positioning

VISUAL REFERENCES (style, not content):
- Apple logo simplicity
- IBM logo authority
- Slack logo minimalism
- Teladoc healthcare credibility
- Bell Labs sound wave patterns (conceptually)

OUTPUT:
High-resolution PNG (3000x3000px minimum), professional quality, production-ready. Should look like a logo from a Fortune 500 tech company's healthcare division.

Additional requirement: The logo should work equally well as:
1. A centered square icon (app icon)
2. A horizontal lockup with "Voxanne AI" text to the right
3. A standalone mark without any text
4. A favicon (small, 16x16, still recognizable)
```

### Variation A: With Stethoscope Integration

```
Same as above, BUT integrate a subtle stethoscope element (just the circular earpieces and curved tube) into or around the central node, so the sound waves emerge from a stethoscope listening point. This bridges healthcare + voice. Should be so subtle that viewers might not notice the stethoscope at first glance, but once they do, it's perfect. Medical listening + AI hearing.

Result: More healthcare-specific than generic tech. Still feels like a premium AI brand, not a doctor's office tool.
```

---

## PROMPT 2: The Medical Voice Fusion

### Full Prompt (For Alternative Concept Testing)

```
Design a sophisticated, minimalist logo for "Voxanne AI," a premium medical AI voice platform.

CORE CONCEPT:
A stylized stethoscope merged with a voice/audio waveform. Imagine a traditional stethoscope, but instead of a tube, a smooth audio waveform flows through it or curves alongside it. The stethoscope earpieces should be elegant and geometric, not realistic. The waveform should suggest both healthcare monitoring and AI voice patterns.

DESIGN APPROACH:
Modern, geometric, professional healthcare aesthetic (like premium telemedicine apps). Tech-forward enough to suggest AI, but medical enough to suggest healthcare authority. Premium, not casual.

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Deep medical blue (#0066CC) for the stethoscope outline
- Secondary: White for the waveform/interior
- Accent: Cyan (#00A8E8) for the waveform line to suggest voice/energy
- Must work in monochrome (single blue)

STYLE DIRECTION:
- Not literal or photorealistic (too medical-cliché)
- Geometric and abstract (modern tech aesthetic)
- Minimalist (fewer details, more impact)
- Premium feel (comparable to Figma, Slack, Notion)
- Professional credibility (healthcare trustworthiness)

SPECIFICATIONS:
- Scalable from 16x16px to 512x512px
- Works on light and dark backgrounds
- Icon form and horizontal lockup variations
- Clean, no gradients, solid colors preferred
- Healthcare-specific but tech-forward (not old-fashioned medicine)

MUST COMMUNICATE:
✓ Medical authority and listening
✓ Voice/AI technology and sound
✓ Healthcare professionalism
✓ Modern technology and innovation
✓ Enterprise-grade reliability

WHAT TO AVOID:
✗ Clichéd medical imagery (too hospital-like)
✗ Overly realistic stethoscope (looks dated)
✗ Waveforms that look like generic tech (need medical context)
✗ Anything that feels consumer-facing or casual

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:
More healthcare-specific than Google or ChatGPT logos, more modern than traditional medical software, more professional than consumer AI tools.

OUTPUT:
Production-ready PNG, 3000x3000px+, professional quality. This logo should work on business cards, healthcare trade show booths, and enterprise software dashboards.
```

## PROMPT 3: The Intelligence Hub (Network Concept)

### Full Prompt (Enterprise Positioning)

```
Design an enterprise-focused logo for "Voxanne AI," representing secure, intelligent multi-tenant medical infrastructure.

CONCEPT:
A circular arrangement of interconnected nodes (5-7 smaller nodes in a circle or network pattern) with a central empowered hub node. All connected by clean, elegant lines. The central node is slightly larger and brighter, representing Voxanne at the center of a secure medical network. Nodes can be simple circles or slightly geometric shapes.

STYLE:
Modern, geometric, minimalist enterprise software aesthetic. Think Cisco, IBM, or enterprise healthcare software. Professional, trustworthy, architectural. Not playful or trendy.

COLOR CODING:
- Central node: Bright medical blue (#0066CC), representing Voxanne
- Connecting lines: Medical blue (#0066CC), suggesting secure pathways
- Outer nodes: Light blue (#E6F2FF) or white, representing connected healthcare organizations/clinics
- Optional: Cyan (#00A8E8) accents at connection points for energy/intelligence
- Must be monochrome-functional (works in single blue)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Suggest secure multi-tenancy (each org is a separate node, but connected)
- Convey intelligent orchestration (central intelligence distributing to nodes)
- Communicate network reliability and security
- Appear sophisticated and enterprise-grade
- Scalable and clean at all sizes

SPECIFICATIONS:
- Scalable from small (favicon) to large (billboard)
- Works in color, monochrome, and inverted (white on blue)
- Icon-only version and horizontal lockup with text
- Geometric, no realistic rendering
- No gradients or textures (solid fills)

VISUAL MESSAGE:
✓ Security and isolation (separate nodes = separate orgs, but trusted connections)
✓ Intelligence and orchestration (central node managing the network)
✓ Healthcare network and connectivity
✓ Distributed system architecture
✓ Enterprise reliability and scale

AVOID:
✗ Generic "network" diagrams (too common)
✗ Overly complex patterns (must work at small sizes)
✗ Anything looking like blockchain (wrong message)
✗ Chaotic or random node placement (need coherent design)

CONTEXT:
This logo should appeal to enterprise healthcare buyers and CIOs who understand distributed systems and multi-tenancy benefits. Use in sales decks, technical documentation, and enterprise marketing.

OUTPUT:
Professional PNG 3000x3000px+. Should look like infrastructure architecture visualized as a logo. Perfect for enterprise healthcare software company.
