so I have a company called call waiting AI and the company's domain is call waiting AI dot deaf now call waiting here you do Dave if you analyse the product of the company you find out what is about but I want to create an album agent that will help me to score companies to sell the product to the name of the product the name of the company is called waiting AI understand call waiting AI Ltd in the UK but the name of the products like the name of the answering machine I'm selling is not just an AI agent that I'm selling an answering machine you know there's a dashboard there's an analysis dashboard you know what I did was I you know white labelled vapi you understand I am I created my own dashboard but I'm using vapi for the orchestration


To help Call Waiting AI surpass the traditional "Underdog" technique, your AI agent needs to move beyond just being "disarming." It needs to become an "Indifferent Data-Driven Expert."
Because you have an Analysis Dashboard, your AI has a "weapon" Giulio doesn't: Proof. While Giulio has to guess that a prospect is missing calls, your AI can reference specific data points to make the sale feel like a foregone conclusion.
1. The "Scoring" Strategy (Pre-Call)
Before your agent even dials, you should "score" companies by looking for High-Intent/Low-Response signals. Have your system (or a separate automation) look for:
 * Google Review Scrapers: Find businesses with 1-star reviews that say "No one picked up" or "Left three voicemails, no reply."
 * Service-Based Industries: Focus on high-ticket UK niches (Private Clinics, Solicitors, Roofers, Aesthetic Centers) where one missed call = £500+ lost.
 * The "Secret Shopper" Test: Have a script call them at 5:05 PM (just after closing). If it goes to a standard, boring UK "Press 1 for..." or a full mailbox, they are a 10/10 Score.
2. The "Super-Underdog" System Prompt
Copy and paste this into your AI Agent's (Vapi) System Instructions.
Role: You are a low-pressure, slightly skeptical consultant for Call Waiting AI. Your voice tone is calm, not enthusiastic. You sound like a technician, not a salesman.
Objective: To see if the prospect is actually losing money from missed calls, and if they care enough to stop it.
The "Super-Underdog" Rules:
 * The Permission Opener: Never start with "How are you today?" Start by acknowledging you are an interruption.
 * The "Data Bomb": Mention a specific reason why you called (e.g., "I noticed your office was closed at 5 PM yesterday").
 * The Indifference Loop: If they sound busy, agree with them immediately and offer to hang up.
 * The Dashboard Hook: Focus on the "Analysis" part. Don't sell an "Answering Machine"; sell "Visibility into Lost Revenue."
3. The Script: "Call Waiting AI" Outbound Agent
The Opener (Pattern Interrupt):
> "Hi [Name], I’m calling from Call Waiting AI. I’ll be totally honest—this is one of those cold calls. Do you want to hang up on me now, or can I have 25 seconds to tell you why I specifically called [Business Name]?"
> 
The Insight (The "Supersede" Move):
> "Reason I called is I actually ran a quick check on your phone line's 'response rate' after hours. It looks like calls are just hitting a standard voicemail. Usually, for [Industry], that's about 3–4 lost leads a week. Are you guys already so busy that you’re happy letting those go to the competition, or is that actually a bit of a headache?"
> 
The Objection Handling (The Underdog Lean):
 * If they say "We’re fine": "Fair enough. Most people think they're fine until they see our Analysis Dashboard—it actually tracks the calls you don't see. But if you’ve got more business than you can handle, I don't want to be the guy trying to sell you a solution to a problem you don't have. Sound fair?"
 * If they say "Send an email": "I can do that. But my emails are usually a bit long because they include the missed-call data for your area. Should I just send the 'how-to' guide, or do you actually want to see the dashboard stats for your line?"
The Closing (Low-Stakes):
> "Look, I’m not looking for a marriage proposal today. I just want to show you the dashboard for 5 minutes. If you hate it, you never have to speak to me again. Is Thursday morning a bad time to look at the data?"
> 
4. Technical Implementation Advice (Vapi/UK Context)
 * Voice Selection: Use a "British Professional" voice (e.g., ElevenLabs "Marcus" or "Alice"). Avoid overly American or robotic tones.
 * The "Human" Pause: Program a 700ms delay when they ask a difficult question. In the "Underdog" style, this makes the AI seem like it’s "thinking" or "considering" their point, which feels more authentic than an instant response.
 * UK Compliance: Since you are Call Waiting AI Ltd in the UK, ensure your AI mentions "GDPR compliant call recording" early if they ask about how it works—it builds instant professional trust.
Would you like me to refine the "Handling Objections" list specifically for the UK market (e.g., handling "gatekeepers" or receptionists)?**

WHEN SELLING Your AI receptionist, what's the right pain points to tackle? What do you ask the owner? I'm no expert, right? I'm just somebody that makes $50k a month selling AI over the phone and emails. Whatever I share is what works for me. When I'm making cold calls, I always think about it like a roller coaster. I have to make them go through their roller coaster. What I mean by that is when somebody picks up your phone, when a business owner picks up your cold call, their ego is very high. It's like right here. They don't know that they have a problem. The business is running fine. Everything is good. And then you have to bring them down. The way you bring them down is by asking the right questions, not by being disrespectful or anything. You just ask the right questions and then you bring them up again by offering your solution. So let me give you a scenario on how I would bring somebody from here to here. John, how many calls would you say come in per week? 300. Okay, and how many of those are you missing? Just an estimate's fine, just a percentage - 30%. So like a third of your revenue? Jeez, okay. What's your average customer value? $200. So you're losing like $18,000 a week. Wow that's a lot. Do you have somebody calling those people back or do they just go to voicemail? Damn, so did you see what I did there? I made this business owner realize that they have a huge problem which they probably didn't even know. And then I brought them down and the way I would bring them up again is by offering my solution. "Yeah, John, I think my solution is actually perfect for you. If you have time tomorrow, I can have my team create a completely custom AI so you can actually hear the technology and how it would work in your business." That's it, right? You're not selling cool tech, you're selling revenue. A lot of people they'll just try to Yeah, I have an AI, it's ultra realistic, it's 24-7, sounds just like a human. Like, yeah, those things are really cool, but if it's not solving their problem or making them more money, they're not gonna buy even though it's really cool. Follow me on
